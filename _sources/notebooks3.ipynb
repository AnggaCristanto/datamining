Metode yang juga dikenal sebagai Naive Bayes Classifier ini menerapkan teknik supervised klasifikasi objek di masa depan dengan menetapkan label kelas ke instance/catatan menggunakan probabilitas bersyarat. Probabilitas bersyarat adalah ukuran peluang suatu peristiwa yang terjadi berdasarkan peristiwa lain yang telah (dengan asumsi, praduga, pernyataan, atau terbukti) terjadi. \n","\n","Istilah supervised merujuk pada klasifikasi training data yang sudah diberi label dengan kelas. Misalnya, sebuah transaksi penipuan telah ditandai sebagai data transaksional. Kemudian, jika Anda ingin mengklasifikasikan transaksi di masa depan menjadi fraudulent/non-fraudulent (penipuan/non-penipuan), maka jenis klasifikasi itu akan disebut sebagai supervised.\n","\n","Nah, model machine learning yang diterapkan pada program tersebut menggunakan teorema Bayes yang dirumuskan sebagai berikut:\n","\n","$$ P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) \\, P(A)}{P(B)} $$"],"metadata":{"id":"85vJHOBdFO8d"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##
